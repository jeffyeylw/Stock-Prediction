# Stock-Prediction
Stock Prediction of hourly prices for Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) 

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Analysis: 1. Data collection and preprocessing: Did you collect and preprocess the data effectively? 2. Data exploration: Did you explore the data using data visualization tools to identify patterns or trends? 3. Predictive model: Did you build an effective predictive model using machine learning algorithms? 4. Model evaluation: Did you evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics? 5. Generalization: Did you test the model on a separate dataset to see how well it generalizes to new data? 6. Stock price prediction: Did you use your model to predict the future prices of the three stocks and test it with the latest/real-time stock dataset?

Performance:  The performance (evaluated by MSE for every hour, i.e., 9am, 10am, 11am, etc.) tested on 13 Nov will be taken as one of the indicators. Please submit your predictions on 13 Nov as a separate file so that we can evaluate your performance.
